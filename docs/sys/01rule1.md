# The First Rule: Find your own rules.
Here's an idea: much of our success in SE and KE come from a few
dozen patterns on how we code and how we organize the teams that
do that coding.  So while it it great to study the latest and
greatest ideas from software engineering and knowledge  engineering,
lets not forget the basics.  
_SCRIPT101_ is an repository for those patterns. Some are process patterns (how we build things). Some are patterns in
the code we build. And some are high-level architectural decisions about how the big parts of a system fit together. 
Whatever their nature, each makes it mark on a software project. One way to check a project is to look for those marks,
then ask about any missing ones.
> **IMPORTANT POINT**
My patterns may not be your patterns.
None of these patterns are essential. Software does not crash and die if some pattern is absent. Nevertheless,  for the missing ones,
it can be useful to as "why is it missing?" and "should we use it?". 
I urge you to think abut what patterns are useful for your team. Then, for each such pattern, build checklists or scripts that can
check for the presence (or abscence) of that pattern. Further, those checklists/scripts should be run (often) and the results
shared across the whole team. Finally, the patterns nobody uses should be retired and the patterns everyone uses should
be taught to newcomers when they enter a project. In this way, groups can evolve a shared understanding of useful
(or otherwise) practices in the local community.
Have fun!
