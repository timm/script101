<h4><a name=ARCH></a>ARCH: Architecture, matters</h4>
<p><img align=right width=500 src="https://ares.decipherzone.com/blog-manager/uploads/ckeditor_Types%20of%20Software%20Architecture%20Patterns.png"></p>
<p>Informally, architectires divide up big projects such that teams, or people, can work productilvy on their own bits while also playing well with others. </p>
<p>More formally, says Wikipedia, Software architectures are the set of structures needed to reason about a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.  There are many kinds of architectures (see figure
at right at some notes from the DecipherZone<sup id="fnref:Arch1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Arch1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Examples:<br />
- <a href="#BLACKBOARDs">Blackboards</a>
- <a href="#LAYERs">Layers</a> 
- <a href="#PIPEs">Pipes</a>
- etc. </p>
<p>One important feture about archtectures is that   reflecting on architectureal choices is a great way to reflect on large scale options in your system. For example,  the famous Keyword in Context<sup id="fnref:Parnas72"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Parnas72">3</a></sup> example explores
the following requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The KWIC [Key Word in Context index system accepts an ordered set of
lines, each line is an ordered set of words, and each word is an ordered
set of characters. Any line may be ``circularly shifted'' by repeatedly
removing the first word and appending it at the end of the line. The
KWIC index system outputs a listing of all circular shifts of all lines in
alphabetical order.</li>
<li>Garlan and Shaw<sup id="fnref:Garlan92"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Garlan92">2</a></sup> explore four different designs (listed below) and score them as per the following table. 
  For details on that discussion, see their text.</li>
<li><em>Shared memory</em>: This is a classic "procedural design" where the functionality is divided hierathically and all functions can read/write to same 
     shared memory.</li>
<li><em>Abstact  data types</em>: This is the classic "object-oriented design" where each module has an interface offering services to anyone that wants them by invoking procedures in that interface.</li>
<li><em>Events</em>: all services watch the data and are implicitedly triggered when certain parts of the data change in specific ways (for example,
the act of adding a new line to the line storage causes an event to be sent to the
shift module)</li>
<li><em>Pipes and Filters</em>: Data runs in a linear way through a set of small filters (and the output of one
    filter is the input to the next). </li>
</ul>

<p>You may disagree with some of these rankings (and to explore that, we would have to read in detail their text).
But stepping back from the details, I say that the important part  of archiectures  is that they make us ask the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often do you reflect on <strong>multiple</strong> designs before selecting one?</li>
<li>Are you knowledgable in multiple architectures?</li>
<li>What are your rules for selecting one architeture over another?</li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed discussion on the last points, see <a href="#NFR">non-functional requirements</a>
Models of choices: softare product lines.</p>
<p>Note that once we have choices, we can explore those choices manually our automatically with <a href="#CONFIG">configuration</a> algorithms.</p>
<h4><a name=AUTO></a>AUTO: Automate Everything (as mucha s you can)</h4>
<p>idioms, alias, scripts, make, tests </p>
<p>auto Make on commit. </p>
<h3>B</h3>
<h4><a  name=BEI></a> BEI: Beware evil input</h4>
<p>Never accept unfiltered text from outside the program (since it may contain evils strings) and <strong>never</strong>  evaulated raw text. Instead, build yourself a parser that only accepts the (very limited) ranges of things you   except   (and reqjects everything else). </p></p>
<p>In Python, that is already available in the  <strong>ast.literal_eval</strong> function. This function will convert strings into booleans, integers, floats, and even strings (if appropriate)  while crashing on everything else.</p></p>

<p>Note only that, by stakeholders assess their code on a range of criteria, not all of which everyone
agrees on, and not all of which can be achieved at the same time:</p>
