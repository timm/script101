# The First, Most Important,  Rule: Find your own rules.
> While it it great to study the latest and
greatest ideas from software engineering and knowledge  engineering,
we should not forget the basics.

Much of our success in SE and KE come from a few
dozen patterns that describe how best to  code (and organize the teams that
do that coding).
_SCRIPT101_ is an repository for those patterns. 

There are many kinds of patterns.  Some are process patterns that tell us how we should build things. Some are patterns in
the code we build. And some are high-level architectural decisions about how the big parts of a system fit together. 
Whatever their nature, each pattern leaves an **impression** on a software project. 
For example, if we believe in ["no internal boundaries"](02noboundaries.md) then that 
we should be able to look 
at a project and get the impression
that many developers are sharing much of the same config files (since many people
are using the same tools).

One way to check a project is to check  for those impressions,
then ask about any missing ones.

> **IMPORTANT POINT**
My patterns may not be your patterns.
None of the patterns listed here are essential
since  software does not crash and die if some pattern is absent. 
So what impresses me most about a project may not be so important for you.
Nevertheless,  my more general point is that when you can't find what  impresses you,
it can be useful to as "why is it missing?" and "should we use it?". 

I urge you to think about what patterns are useful for your team and
how you can check if it is being used.
Then:

-  For each such pattern, build checklists or scripts that can
check for the presence (or abscence) of that pattern. 
- Those
checklists/scripts should be run (often) and the results shared
across the whole team. 
- Further, the patterns nobody uses, or the patterns
that impress no one,  should be
retired. 
- Finally, the patterns everyone uses should be taught to newcomers
when they enter a project. 

In this way, groups can evolve a shared
understanding of useful (or otherwise) practices in the local
community.

Have fun!

## Exercises
- Think about the software you know and write down what impresses you.
- How would you be able to check for what impresses you?
- How early in a project could that check be performed?
