# Distributed Development Model
> Team Pattern


From the Linux Kernal Report[^kernel]:

- Process scalability requires a distributed, hierarchical development
model.
- Once upon a time, all changes went directly to Linus Torvalds, but
even a developer with his talents cannot keep up with a project
moving as quickly as the kernel. 
- Spreading out the responsibility
for code review and integration across 100 or more maintainers gives
the project the resources to cope with tens of thousands of changes
without sacrificing review or quality.

## Exercies:
- Given the information in a standard Github repository, how might we check 
  for the presence (or otherwose) of distributed development?
