From the Linux Kernal Report[^kernel]:

- The kernelâ€™s strongly consensus-oriented model is important.  
- As a
general rule, a proposed change will not be merged if a respected
developer is opposed to it. 
- This can be intensely frustrating to
developers who find code they have put months into blocked on the
mailing list, but it also ensures that the kernel remains suited
to a wide ranges of users and problems.  
- No particular user community
is able to make changes at the expense of other groups. 
- As a result,
we have a kernel that scales from tiny systems to supercomputers
and that is suitable for a huge range of uses.
